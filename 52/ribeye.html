    <h1>What Is A Rib Eye Steak</h1>
    <p>Rib-eye steak is considered one of the best steaks on the market. The rib-eye is cut from the roast—known as a
        prime rib or standing rib roast—that sits at the top of the rib primal, the part of the cow between the chuck
        and the loin. The rib-eye is basically the meat between each of the ribs, which makes it a boneless cut; it is
        best grilled or broiled.

        What Is Rib-Eye Steak?
        This highly desired cut of meat deserves top billing due to its full flavor and soft texture. The generous
        amount of marbling (fat running through the meat) makes for a rich taste and juicy finish. Because this area of
        the cow gets little exercise, the muscle isn't used much and therefore the meat is nice and tender. Rib-eye is
        often a decent size, filling up the plate, making for an impressive steak dinner.
